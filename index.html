          "A component with no events"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "A component whose value is controlled by state",
        explanation: "In `EmoList`, the search input is controlled because its `value` is tied to the `txt` state, updated via `onChange`."
      },
      {
        id: 13,
        question: "What happens if `useEffect` has an empty dependency array?",

        ],
        correctAnswer: "It runs only once on mount",
        explanation: "An empty dependency array `[]` in `useEffect` means the effect runs once when the component mounts."
      },
      {
        id: 14,
        question: "What is JSX in React?",
        options: [

      },
      {
        id: 16,
        question: "What does `setState` do in `useState`?",
        options: [
          "Renders the component",
          "Updates the state and triggers a re-render",
          "Fetches data",
          "Handles events"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Updates the state and triggers a re-render",

          "To clear the input",
          "To style the input"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "To update the `txt` state",
        explanation: "The `onChange` event in `EmoList` updates the `txt` state with `setTxt(e.target.value)`, triggering filtering."
      },
      {
        id: 19,
        question: "What happens if you call `setState` inside `useEffect` without a dependency array?",
        options: [
          "It causes an infinite loop",
          "It runs once",
          "It crashes the app",
          "It does nothing"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "It causes an infinite loop",
        explanation: "Without a dependency array, `useEffect` runs on every render, and calling `setState` causes a re-render, leading to an infinite loop."
      },
      {
        id: 20,
        question: "How can you prevent `useEffect` from running on every render?",
        options: [
          "Remove `useEffect`",
          "Add a dependency array",
          "Use `useState` instead",
          "Add an `onClick` event"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Add a dependency array",
        explanation: "A dependency array in `useEffect` specifies when the effect should run, preventing it from running on every render."
